# GF1
Program to implement the first type of finite field Zp, and four operations “+”, “-”, “*”, and “/”, respectively. Program will read a modulus 'p' and two elements x and y from a file named “input.txt” , then it should create a file named “output.txt” and write the results to “output.txt”.   In “input.txt”:  1. First line is the prime number p.  2. Second line is an element x which belongs to Zp.  3. Third line is another element y which belongs to Zp.   In “output.txt”:  1. First line is x + y in Zp.  2. Second line is x - y in Zp.  3. Third line is x * y in Zp.  4. Fourth line is x / y in Zp
